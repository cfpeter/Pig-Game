# Pig-Game
1 In each turn a player rolls a die repeatedly until either a 1 is rolled or player decides to hold and pass on the turn to its opponent. 

2 The number player rolls is added to a temporary score. If the player rolls a 1, they lose their temporary score and turn is passed to their opponent.                

3 If player gets any other number, they can decide to continue and roll the die.

4 If player decides to hold, then their turn total (temporary score) is added to the overall score.                  

5 The first player to score 100 points wins the game.

6 You can also change the win points (makes it more fun)
